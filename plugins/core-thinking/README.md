# Core Thinking

Structured thinking frameworks and reasoning tools for systematic problem-solving.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `collision-zone-thinking` | Identify where assumptions, constraints, or requirements conflict |
| `defense-in-depth-validation` | Layer multiple validation strategies for high-confidence results |
| `inversion-exercise` | Solve problems by reasoning backward from failure states |
| `meta-pattern-recognition` | Detect recurring structural patterns across different domains |
| `root-cause-tracing` | Trace symptoms to their underlying causes systematically |
| `scale-game` | Stress-test designs by exploring behavior at extreme scales |
| `simplification-cascades` | Reduce complexity through iterative simplification passes |
| `when-stuck` | Structured approaches for breaking through problem-solving blocks |
| `reasoning-tools` | MCP-based reasoning tools (code-reasoning, shannon-thinking) |

## Usage

These skills are invoked as thinking aids during complex tasks. They pair well with tier 3+ workflows where deep analysis is required before implementation.
